# Introduction

Welcome to PenCode, a creative coding environment designed specifically for generative art. Whether you are a seasoned artist, a developer curious about creative coding, or a beginner taking your first steps, PenCode provides a simple yet powerful platform to bring your ideas to life.

## What is PenCode?

PenCode is a tool that lets you create images and patterns through code. Instead of drawing with a mouse, you write simple instructions to describe shapes, lines, colors, and their relationships. This approach allows for precision, complexity, and repeatability that is often difficult to achieve with traditional tools.

Our goal is to make generative art accessible and enjoyable. The language is designed to be easy to learn, but it is also capable of producing highly intricate and beautiful results.

## Who is it For?

PenCode is for anyone interested in the intersection of art and code:

-   **Artists and Designers:** Explore new forms of visual expression and create complex patterns that would be tedious to draw by hand.
-   **Developers:** Apply your coding skills in a creative context and explore the world of generative algorithms.
-   **Educators and Students:** PenCode is an excellent tool for teaching the fundamentals of programming in a visual and engaging way.

## Contributing to PenCode
